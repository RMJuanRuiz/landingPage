Hello!

To create this landing page I used the follow libaries:

- RxJS: To do the API requests and control the data returned.
- Glide.js: To create the carousel.
- Bootstrap 4: I used the grid and some of its utilities.

Let me know if you have some doubt.
You can see my repository on github here: https://github.com/RMJuanRuiz

Also you can see the landing page online in this web:
