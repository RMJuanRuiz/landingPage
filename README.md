Hello!

To create this landing page I used the follow libaries:

- RxJS: To do the API requests and control the data returned.
- Glide.js: To create the carousel.
- Bootstrap 4: I used the grid and some of its utilities.
- AOS: To animate the page.

The design is totally responsive and based in mobile first.

Let me know if you have some doubt :)
